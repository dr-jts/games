## Cribbage

### Deal
* 2 players: 6 cards; discard 2 to crib
* 3 players: 5 cards, plus one to crib; discard 1 to crib
* 4 players: 5 cards; discard 1 to crib
* 5 players: 5 cards, except 4 to dealer; discard (except dealer) 1 to crib 

## Hearts

* Best for 4 or more players

### Deal
* For 2 or 4 players use entire deck (26 or 13 cards each).
* For 3 players remove the 2 Diamonds (17 cards each).
* For 5 players, remove 2 Clubs as well (10 cards each).
* Deal all cards  

### Gameplay:
* There is no trump.
* Hearts can't be lead until broken.  Queen of Spades can be lead at any time.
* Player should pile taken tricks face down, to avoid card counting

### Scoring
* At the end of each hand, players count the number of hearts they have taken as well as the queen of spades, if applicable.   Hearts count as one point each and the queen counts 13 points.
  * Each heart - 1 point
  * The Q - 13 points
* The total of all scores for each hand must be a multiple of 26.
* The game is played to 100 points (some play to 50).
* **Taking Control**: if a player takes all 13 hearts and the queen of spades in one hand, that player scores zero and each opponent scores 26 points.

## Lambsy

Lambsy is a rummy-style card game where the objective of each hand is to be the first to get rid of all your cards. Players aim to lay down combinations of cards, either **runs** (sequences of the same suit) or **sets** (three or four of a kind). Players can add to their own or other players' **melds** (combinations). In the first hand Aces are **wild**, followed by twos, threes, and so on up to Kings.  A hand ends when one player discards their last card. The player with the fewest points (based on the value of cards left in their hands) wins. If multiple hands are played the game ends when one player reaches a set score (e.g. 100 or 250). 

### Deal
* Create a score sheet with columns for each player. Label each row with the wild card value.
* Standard deck of 52 cards.
* Deal: 10 each cards for 2 players, 7 cards each for 3-4 players, 6 cards for more.
* Start a discard pile with the top card of the stock. 

### Wild Cards:
* Wild card(s) can be used to represent card(s) in a meld or set
* Players can liberate (replace) wild cards from other players' melds by substituting the card it represents.
* The wild card changes each round, starting with Aces in the first round, then twos, threes, up to Kings.
  
### Gameplay:
Turns:
* Players take turns drawing a card (from the stock or discard pile) and discarding one.
* If the stock pile runs out, turn over the discard pile without shuffling
  
Melding:
* Players can lay down combinations (melds) of three or more cards (runs or sets).
* Aces are low (for runs)
* Players may not lay off until they have played at least one meld
  
Laying Off:
* After melding, players can add cards to existing melds on the table, either their own or other players'.

Discarding:
* To signal the end of their turn a player discards one card to the discard pile
  
Going Rummy
* If a player who has not yet laid down can meld or lay off all their cards in one turn this is **going rummy**.
* Scores for other players are doubled.
  
Going Out:
* The hand ends when a player discards their last card. 
  
### Scoring
* Players add the value of the cards remaining in their hands:
  * Face cards (J, Q, K) are 10 points,
  * Aces are 1 (or 11 if allowed to be high; or 15, depending on the rules).
  * Numbered cards are worth their face value. 

### Winning
Play hands until one player reaches a target score (often 100 or 250 points). 
Lowest score at the end of the game wins. 

## 31
Objective is to have one or more cards in the same suit which total 31,
OR which total higher than some other player's hand.

### Setup
* Each player gets 3 chips

### Deal 
* Cut for deal (high card), or choose a dealer
* 3 cards to each player
* Stock is placed face down
* One card placed face up for discard pile

### Play
* At the start of their turn the player can **knock** if they think their hand is worth more than that of some other player
  * when a player knocks, each other player gets one more chance to improve their hand.  A player may declare 31, in which case they win the hand. 
* Otherwise, the player draws a card from either stock or discard pile
* The player can **declare 31** if their hand is worth 31 (e.g. Ace and two 10 cards in same suit).  In this case they win the hand
* Otherwise, they discard a card (but NOT the one drawn from the discard pile)

### Scoring
* Aces are high; face cards are worth 10
* A hand value is the highest total of cards in one suit

### Winning
* If player declares 31, every other player loses the hand
* If player has knocked, the lowest hand(s) loses the hand
* Players who lose put one chip into the kitty in the centre of the table.
  ** A player who knocks and loses pays two chips (if they have that many)
* In event of a draw, replay the hand
  
* When a player has no chips left, they are **on welfare**. If they lose while on welfare, you are out of the game. If you lose two chips with only one chip left you are also out of the game.
  * A player who has been on welfare can stay at the table, and if they are accidentally dealt back in they are back in the game, on welfare   
* The game continues until only one player is left.

## 99
The objective of the game is to avoid playing a card which makes the hand total go over 99.

### Setup
* 2-4 players: 5 chips
* more: 3 chips

### Deal
* 3 cards each
* place remainder face-down for stock

### Play
* Player to left of dealer starts, play passes clockwise
* Each player adds a card to the discard pile, calls out the total value, and draws a new card.
  * If player misses drawing card they cannot make it up
* Card values:
  * **Ace**: 1 or 11
  * **Four**: reverse direction of play (call "Back on you #")
  * **Nine**: zero (call "Pass to you #")
  * **Ten**: add OR subtract 10
  * **King**: value set to 99
  * **other**, card face value; Jack and Queen are 10
* If the stock runs out, create a new stock by shuffling all but the top card of the discard pile. The count is unchanged.

### Scoring
* When player cannot play without going over 99, they toss in a chip and hand ends.
* When player is out of chips they get one bonus hand.  If they lose again they are out.
* If an out player is dealt in accidentally, they rejoin the game.

### Winning
* Winner is the last player to have chips
