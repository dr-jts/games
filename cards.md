## Cribbage

### Deal
* 2 players: 6 cards; discard 2 to crib
* 3 players: 5 cards, plus one to crib; discard 1 to crib
* 4 players: 5 cards; discard 1 to crib
* 5 players: 5 cards, except 4 to dealer; discard (except dealer) 1 to crib 

## Hearts

* Best for 4 or more players

### Deal
* For 2 or 4 players use entire deck (26 or 13 cards each).
* For 3 players remove the 2 Diamonds (17 cards each).
* For 5 players, remove 2 Clubs as well (10 cards each).
* Deal all cards  

### Gameplay:
* There is no trump.
* Hearts can't be lead until broken.  Queen of Spades can be lead at any time.
* Player should pile taken tricks face down, to avoid card counting

### Scoring
* At the end of each hand, players count the number of hearts they have taken as well as the queen of spades, if applicable.   Hearts count as one point each and the queen counts 13 points.
  * Each heart - 1 point
  * The Q - 13 points
* The total of all scores for each hand must be a multiple of 26.
* The game is played to 100 points (some play to 50).
* **Taking Control**: if a player takes all 13 hearts and the queen of spades in one hand, that player scores zero and each opponent scores 26 points.

## Lambsy

Lambsy is a rummy-style card game where the objective of each hand is to be the first to get rid of all your cards. Players aim to lay down combinations of cards, either **runs** (sequences of the same suit) or **sets** (three or four of a kind). Players can add to their own or other players' **melds** (combinations). In the first hand Aces are **wild**, followed by twos, threes, and so on up to Kings.  A hand ends when one player discards their last card. The player with the fewest points (based on the value of cards left in their hands) wins. If multiple hands are played the game ends when one player reaches a set score (e.g. 100 or 250). 

### Deal
* Create a score sheet with columns for each player. Label each row with the wild card value.
* Standard deck of 52 cards.
* Deal: 10 each cards for 2 players, 7 cards each for 3-4 players, 6 cards for more.
* Start a discard pile with the top card of the stock. 

### Wild Cards:
* Wild card(s) can be used to represent card(s) in a meld or set
* Players can liberate (replace) wild cards from other players' melds by substituting the card it represents.
* The wild card changes each round, starting with Aces in the first round, then twos, threes, up to Kings.
  
### Gameplay:
Turns:
* Players take turns drawing a card (from the stock or discard pile) and discarding one.
* If the stock pile runs out, turn over the discard pile without shuffling
  
Melding:
* Players can lay down combinations (melds) of three or more cards (runs or sets).
* Aces are low (for runs)
* Players may not lay off until they have played at least one meld
  
Laying Off:
* After melding, players can add cards to existing melds on the table, either their own or other players'.

Discarding:
* To signal the end of their turn a player discards one card to the discard pile
  
Going Rummy
* If a player who has not yet laid down can meld or lay off all their cards in one turn this is **going rummy**.
* Scores for other players are doubled.
  
Going Out:
* The hand ends when a player discards their last card. 
  
### Scoring:
* Players add the value of the cards remaining in their hands:
  * Face cards (J, Q, K) are 10 points,
  * Aces are 1 (or 11 if allowed to be high; or 15, depending on the rules).
  * Numbered cards are worth their face value. 

### Winning:
Play hands until one player reaches a target score (often 100 or 250 points). 
Lowest score at the end of the game wins.
